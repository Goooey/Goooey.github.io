     	<h2>Steps</h2>
     	<ol>
     		<li>First thing you want to do is boil your noodles in a large pot
     		</li>
     		<li>Wait until it reaches a rolling boil without stopping and add some salt in there too.</li>
     		<li>Lay inside and once they soften a bit gently push down so the whole piece is submerged.</li>
     	</ol>
     	<h2>How long does it take</h2>
     	<p>As little as 10 minutes, to 15 depending on how hot your water is. You don’t want them to be put into water that isn’t boiling rigorously or they will get soggy. Turn water off when they are still a bit al dente as they’ll continue softening once you layer your ingredients and bake. While this is happening, chop your onions and mince the garlic. Put into a large frying pan, then add your ground beef and pork sausage together on medium high heat until no longer pink. Pour in your bottled or homemade Instant Pot spaghetti sauce and heat. Then set aside. </p>

     	<h2>Steps</h2>
     	<ol>
     		<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
            <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
            <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
     	<h2>How long does it take</h2>
     	<p>What Is the Average Time to Cook a Pizza? A pizza may take between 8-15 minutes to bake to perfection. A larger, thicker pizza will take longer than a small, thin-crust one with few toppings. Frozen pizzas can take longer than fresh ones since they usually thaw as they are cooking, which will add extra time </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl or stand mixer add the yeast, water and a pinch of the sugar or honey. Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes until foaming and bubbly. (This is called “proofing” the yeast, to make sure it is active. If it doesn’t foam, the yeast is no good, and you need to start over with fresh yeast).</li>
            <li>Add remaining sugar or honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour. Mix to combine. Add another cup of flour and mix to combine. With the mixer running add more flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix the dough for 5 minutes on medium speed (or knead with your hands on a lightly floured surface, for 5-8 minutes). The dough should be smooth and elastic, and slightly stick to a clean finger, but not be overly sticky.</li>
            <li>Grease a large bowl with oil or cooking spray and place the dough inside. Cover with a dish towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place* until doubled in size (about 1 ½ hours).</li>
            <li>Punch the dough down really well to remove air bubbles.</li>
            <li> Shape each ball into long logs and place into greased loaf pans.</li>
            <li>Spray two pieces of plastic wrap with cooking spray and lay them gently over the pans. Allow dough to rise again for about 45 minutes to one hour, or until risen 1 inch above the loaf pans.</li>
            <li>Adjust oven racks to lower/middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake bread for about 30-33 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Give the top of a loaf a gentle tap; it should sound hollow.</li>
            <li>Invert the baked loaves onto a wire cooling rack. Brush the tops with butter and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Once cool, store bread in an airtight container or bag for 2-3 days at room temperature, or up to 5 days in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How long does it take</h2>
        <p>
        Most recipes call for the bread to double in size – this can take one to three hours, depending on the temperature, moisture in the dough, the development of the gluten, and the ingredients used. Generally speaking, a warm, humid environment is best for rising bread.</p>
